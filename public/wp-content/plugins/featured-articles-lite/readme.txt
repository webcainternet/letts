Featured Articles is a responsive WordPress slider plugin that can create sliders from any existing WordPress content (posts, custom posts, pages or gallery images).

== Description ==

**Featured Articles for WordPress** slider plugin allows you to create sliders in your blog pages directly from your already written content, be it posts, custom posts, pages or WordPress Gallery images. With the ability to change any slider aspect by making use of slideshow themes that are delivered with the plugin, almost anything is possible. Also, it offers the possibility to create additional themes (with some PHP, CSS and JavaScript knowledge) that can have custom written animations by extending the base functionality of the main slider script.

Slideshows can be published in WordPress by any of these ways (or all at the same time):

* manual placement directly into your WordPress theme template files (requires editing the template file you want to place a slideshow in and add a small piece of code);
* shortcode placement directly into a post or page content;
* widget placement into any widget areas your theme has;
* automatic placement in any page just above the page loop.

While Lite version of FeaturedArticles provides all the neccessary tools for creating very nice slideshows, PRO version of this same plugin comes in addition with:

* more slider themes, all video enabled and responsive;
* **video enabled** custom slides for **YouTube and Vimeo** that can embed videos in your WordPress sliders;
* custom slides that can be created using the visual editor;
* sliders can be created from any post type registered on your WordPress website;
* for posts and custom post types, selection of posts by taxonomies;
* mixing of posts, custom posts, pages and custom slides into the same slider;
* visual color scheme editor that allows you to blend-in slideshows into your overall blog design without having to write a single line of CSS;
* priority support and debugging for 3'rd party plugins and themes conflicts;
* cached sliders for faster page loading time;
* possibility to attach videos to any slide (post, custom post, page or custom slide);
* possibility to import video title, description and image as slide title, content and slide image or featured image;
* dynamic slider areas management that allow slider publishing in your WordPress website by simple drag and drop;
* sliders created from WordPress Gallery images;
* and more...

== Installation ==

**Before updating, make sure you back-up all your custom made themes.**

Version 3.0 is a complete plugin rewrite. Previous slider themes won't be compatible by default with this version. You will be able to choose the previous themes but they will issue PHP errors when used.

Sliders created with Featured Articles 2.X will be converted to current version automatically when activating Featured Articles Lite 3.0.

Now, here are the update instructions (automatic update will also work):

If you are upgrading to the current version, make sure you backup all the files of the previous installation. After you backup, make sure that under plugin Setting page, the option to completely unistall the plugin (including content) is unchecked since version 3.X will automatically convert your existing sliders to current version when activating.

Next, either update version 3.X from WordPress admin page Plugins or by FTP. If updatng by FTP, make sure that you first remove the previous plugin version completely before uploading version 3.X.

For any clarifications ask for help on our [Forums] (http://www.codeflavors.com/codeflavors-forums/forum/featured-articles-3-0/ "Featured Articles 3 Forums").
We don't actively monitor the forum here on Wordpres.org so responses to questions posted here might take a while to get answered.

For images detected in post content, the plugin tries to identify the exact attachment from the database and if found, it automatically sets the image into the custom field. The only thing it needs is for the image to have the width and height attributes set in HTML.

* Editable text for read more link

Initial release for the new redesigned Wordpress Featured Articles

== Troubleshooting ==

Plugin is guaranteed to work on a clean WordPress install. Since themes and other plugins don't always play nice, there are a few things you could check if slideshows won't work in your pages:

1. Check that only one jquery file is loaded. Most times, a manually loaded jQuery version in theme header or by a plugin may be the cause. Look in your page source in browser and see if that's the problem.
2. Plugins merging JavaScript and CSS files may also cause problems. In this case, it's all about god intentions with bad results.
3. Use the proper Wordpress version (4 +).
4. See if your theme footer.php file calls wp_footer().

If all options are exhausted, you can always ask for help on our forums at [CodeFlavors Featured Articles WP forum](http://www.codeflavors.com/codeflavors-forums/forum/featured-articles-3-0/ "Featured Articles 3 for WordPress forum"). We'll help you figure out things.
